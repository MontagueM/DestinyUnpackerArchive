# Destiny Unpacker
Put oodle dll in same directory. The oodle dll is from Destiny 2 directory.

Only valid for Destiny 2 versions from Forsaken to 2.9.9.9 (last patch before Beyond Light) due to header and encryption differences. I won't be releasing the new BL-ready version for a while.

the packages/ folder contains a sample package with a few of the extracted contents so you can test if your own unpacker works.

This is a very old version of my own unpacker, so expect bugs/problems. This is why I recommend rewriting it in a language and style of your choice, especially to help with the learning process of how it actually works.
